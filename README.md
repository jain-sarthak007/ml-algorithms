# Gold Price Prediction Project
# Overview
This project aims to predict the price of gold using machine learning methods. The dataset includes gold price data from August 2000 to October 2022, along with other relevant features such as S&P 500 index, crude oil prices, silver prices, and EUR/USD exchange rates.

# Dataset Sample
The dataset sample includes the following columns:

Date: Date of observation.
SPX: S&P 500 index.
GLD: Gold price.
USO: Crude oil prices.
SLV: Silver prices.
EUR/USD: EUR/USD exchange rates.

# Workflow
1. Data Preparation
After importing the data, which includes gold price data, we perform data preparation tasks such as feature engineering and exploratory data analysis. This involves adding lag columns and their statistics to the dataset. A function is defined to automate these tasks with customizable arguments.

2. Machine Learning Model
In this section, we select the RandomForestRegressor as the machine learning model for predicting the gold price. The model is tuned using the verstack library to optimize its performance.

3. Trading Strategy
Finally, we create a trading strategy based on the predicted gold prices from the machine learning model. This strategy aims to generate profits based on the predictions made by the model.

# Conclusion
While financial markets are complex and often require advanced mathematical analysis, this project provides a simplified approach to understanding and predicting gold prices. Future iterations of this project may incorporate more sophisticated mathematical techniques to further enhance prediction accuracy.
