# Students Perfromace Analysis
The dataset had been loaded from kaggle  
# Overview
The Student Performance dataset contains information about students' demographic attributes and their scores in math, reading, and writing exams.
The dataset is commonly used in education research and machine learning to analyze factors influencing students' academic performance.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following attributes:
Gender: Gender of the student (categorical: "female" or "male"),
Race/Ethnicity: Race or ethnicity group of the student (categorical: e.g., "group A", "group B", etc.),
Parental Level of Education: Education level of the student's parents (categorical: e.g., "bachelor's degree", "some college", etc.),
Lunch: Type of lunch received by the student (categorical: "standard" or "free/reduced"),
Test Preparation Course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (categorical: "completed" or "none"),
Course: Subject/course for which the student took the exam (categorical: e.g., "math", "reading", "writing"),
Math Score: Score obtained by the student in the math exam (integer),
Reading Score: Score obtained by the student in the reading exam (integer),
Writing Score: Score obtained by the student in the writing exam (integer).

# Comparison of Algorithms
The decision tree and random forest algorithms are used to compare their performance in predicting students' exam scores. 
The accuracy score of both algorithms will be calculated to determine which one performs better in this task.

# Implementation
You can load the dataset into your preferred machine learning framework or programming environment (e.g., Python with scikit-learn) to implement the comparison of decision tree and random forest algorithms. 
Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models using the training data, and evaluate their performance using the testing data.
